# emotion_recognition

This project investigates the usage of three different model configurations for the task of facial
emotion recognition (FER). An end-to-end classification pipeline is constructed containing a Viola-Jones face
recognition algorithm; a support vector machine with Scale Invariant Feature Transform feature descriptors,
a multi-layer perceptron with Histogram of Gradients feature descriptors, and a deep convolutional neural
network (DCNN) are examined as the pipelinesâ€™ classifiers. The DCNN is identified to greatly outperform
the other methods in both accuracy and speed.
